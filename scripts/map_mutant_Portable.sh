# History: original script designed on MacOSX (Speedy Felix Lab), adpated for PSMN (June 2016), adapted for portable version (Feb. 2017)
# last edit: 2017-02-27

### What is does:
#From a .vcf file containing 1 sample only, it computes for each reported variant position the frequency of reads for the ALT allele over the sum of (REF + ALT) read counts.
#Results are stored in a file named $argument2.freq.txt
#Then plots of frequency and coverage are geneated with a Rcript and stored in a new folder named "plots".

### Requirements:
#This scripts uses the R script Plot-fqcy_Portable.R. The info is given through the config file
#a file containing the scaf names and their sizes

### Usage:
##Run automatically in andalousian-map_Portable.sh (step 9)
#If run independantly:
#			     ($1st arg) ($2nd arg)    ($3rd arg)
#bash map_mutant_Portable.sh myvcf.vcf outfile-prefix config.file
#Take as 1st argument .vcf file restricted to the SNPs of the mapping strain (e.g. JU170)
#2nd argument is the outfile prefix
